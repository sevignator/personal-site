In the spirit of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), I've finally decided to create my own blog!

As an avid learner, this is something that I've considered doing for a while. You see, one of the most effective techniques for consolidating what you learn is through _writing_. Plus, at the risk of being wrong at times, I find the idea of openly documenting that process quite thrilling.

To be frank though, I don't expect anyone but myself to ever consult these pages. The purpose of this blog is to put some of the ideas and discoveries that cross my mind into words. Then, maybe I'll rediscover some of them in the future. But if you've somehow landed here and got anything out of it, more power to you!

I will explore a variety of topics in this blog, including (but not limited to):

- web & software development
- design
- accessibility
- user experience

You can expect new posts to be added regularly!
