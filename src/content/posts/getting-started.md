In the spirit of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), I've finally decided to create my own blog!

As an avid learner, this is something that I've considered doing for a while. You see, one of the most effective techniques for consolidating what you learn is to explain it using your own words. Plus, at the risk of being wrong at times, I find the idea of openly documenting that process to be quite thrilling.

To be frank, I don't expect anyone but myself (and perhaps a friend or two) to ever consult these pages. The purpose of this blog is to take some of the ideas and discoveries that cross my mind, and put them into words. It's a purely selfish endeavor. If you've somehow landed here and got anything out of it, that's a cherry on top!

I will explore a variety of topics in this blog, including (but not limited to):

- web & software development
- design
- accessibility
- user experience

You can expect new posts to be added every now and then!
