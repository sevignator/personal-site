I'm sure you've seen keyword colors many times in the past. From `black` to `white` and everything in-between, they're especially useful for prototyping and debugging.

I mean, who hasn't done something like this once in a while just to make sure that a CSS stylesheet has been properly linked to an HTML document?

```css
html {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

Keyword colors are fairly straightforward; they're self-descriptive and written in plain English! But there's another color-related keyword that's a bit more mysterious, and much less well-known: the `currentColor` keyword.
